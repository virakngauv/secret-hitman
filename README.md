A fun, competitive word selection game. 

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

# TODOs
* Make joining room codes work for mixed cases (upper case doesn't find room)
* Use useContext to avoid passing down params through components
* Rename hint as "messages" and make it an array of strings, and on the GameScreen component, make it so that an Announcer component is generated for each array element
